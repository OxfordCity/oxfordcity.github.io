# oxfordcity.github.io
This is the GitHub Pages site used to supply the front-end for the Oxfordshire Data Portal at www.oxopendata.uk

The main portal uses the Socrata platform, but as this does not enable 'pages' to be created, this site sits in the front to enable additional information to be provided and more easily updated independently of Socrata. Clicking on the 'data' tab takes the visitor to the Socrata portal at www2.oxopendata.uk. 

The styling of this site mirrors that of the Socrata portal so that there is a near-seamless transition for visitors.

The site uses Jekyll to provide a main layout (_layouts/default.html) that can be called by all content pages rather than replicate all the layout code

The main Socrata css files (base.css, current_site.css) are referenced along with a custom.css file for adding any site-specific styling for non-Socrata content
